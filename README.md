# Crack_Detection_and_Segmentation
First task was to develop a binary classification model to identify if a crack is present or not, which is performed by transfer learning and fine tuning Inception V3 model.
Next task was to build a model which predicts the pixel wise segmentation masks of the cracks(if present), which was performed by implementing UNet model architecture.
